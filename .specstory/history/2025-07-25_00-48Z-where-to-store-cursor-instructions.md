# Where to store cursor instructions (2025-07-25 00:48Z)

_**User**_

in which files should I keep instructions for cursor and general context to assure that cursor looks at them?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your project structure and the cursor rules you've already established, here are the key files where you should keep instructions for Cursor and general context:

Based on your project structure and the existing cursor rules, here are the key files where you should keep instructions for Cursor and general context:

## Primary Files for Cursor Context

### 1. **`.cursorrules`** (Already exists - 10KB, 372 lines)
This is the **most important** file for Cursor. It's specifically designed for Cursor to read and follow. You already have comprehensive rules here that include:
- Code style and standards
- Project-specific patterns
- Development workflow
- Testing guidelines
- Performance considerations

### 2. **`README.md`** (5.0KB, 162 lines)
This should contain:
- Project overview and purpose
- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Links to documentation
- High-level architecture overview

### 3. **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** (16KB, 601 lines)
This should contain:
- Detailed development setup
- Contributing guidelines
- Code review process
- Testing procedures
- Release process

### 4. **`pyproject.toml`** (Already well-configured)
This contains:
- Project metadata
- Dependencies
- Tool configurations (black, isort, mypy, pytest)
- Build settings

## Additional Context Files

### 5. **`docs/` directory**
Your existing documentation files should contain:
- `api-reference.md` - API documentation
- `user-guide.md` - User instructions
- `data-format.md` - Data structure documentation
- `export-formats.md` - Export format specifications

### 6. **`examples/` directory**
- `basic_usage.py` - Basic usage examples
- `google_maps_example.py` - Advanced examples
- `sample_locations.yaml` - Sample data format

### 7. **`tests/` directory**
- Test files provide context about expected behavior
- Test data shows proper data formats

## Recommended File Updates


---

Read file: .cursorrules

---

Your `.cursorrules` file is already comprehensive and well-structured! Here are my recommendations for organizing Cursor context:

## Current State Analysis

Your project already has excellent Cursor context organization:

1. **`.cursorrules`** - Comprehensive and well-structured (372 lines)
2. **`README.md`** - Good project overview
3. **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Detailed development guidelines
4. **`pyproject.toml`** - Well-configured tool settings

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Add Project-Specific Context to `.cursorrules`


---

Read file: .cursorrules

---

## Summary: Files for Cursor Context

Based on your project structure, here's the optimal organization for Cursor context:

### **Primary Files (Already Well-Configured)**

1. **`.cursorrules`** ✅ - Your main Cursor configuration (372 lines)
   - Comprehensive code style rules
   - Project-specific patterns
   - Development workflow
   - Testing guidelines

2. **`README.md`** ✅ - Project overview and basic usage
3. **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** ✅ - Detailed development guidelines
4. **`pyproject.toml`** ✅ - Tool configurations and dependencies

### **Additional Context Files**

5. **`docs/` directory** - API and user documentation
6. **`examples/` directory** - Usage examples and sample data
7. **`tests/` directory** - Expected behavior and data formats

### **Recommended Enhancements**

Consider adding these sections to your `.cursorrules`:

1. **AI Agent Context** - Since you have `map_locations_ai/` directory
2. **Data Format Examples** - Reference to your YAML files
3. **Export Format Specifications** - KML, GeoJSON, HTML details
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - For large datasets

Your current setup is already excellent! The `.cursorrules` file is comprehensive and well-structured. The main improvement would be to ensure all your documentation files (`docs/`, `examples/`, etc.) are up-to-date and contain relevant context for Cursor to understand your project's patterns and requirements.

The key is that Cursor will automatically read these files when working on your project, so keeping them current and comprehensive ensures consistent code quality and adherence to your project standards.

  Remember to update these rules as the project evolves and new patterns emerge.
+ 
+ ## AI Agent Integration
+ 
+ ### AI Package Structure
+ - `map_locations_ai/` contains AI-powered location processing
+ - Use `agent/` for AI pipeline components (extractors, enrichers, validators)
+ - Follow `interfaces/` for CLI and web app integration
+ - Maintain separation between core library and AI features
+ 
+ ### AI Data Processing
+ - Validate AI-extracted location data against core models
+ - Use `data_sources/` for external data integration
+ - Implement proper error handling for AI-generated content
+ - Test AI features with `evaluation/` framework
+ 
+ ## Data Format Standards
+ 
+ ### YAML Location Structure
+ ```yaml
+ - name: "Location Name"
+   type: "restaurant|museum|park|etc"
+   latitude: 48.8566
+   longitude: 2.3522
+   tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
+   neighborhood: "District Name"
+   date_added: "2024-01-01"
+   date_of_visit: "2024-01-15"
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Required Fields
+ - `name`, `type`, `latitude`, `longitude` are mandatory
+ - All other fields are optional
+ - Validate coordinate ranges (lat: -90 to 90, lon: -180 to 180)
+ 
+ ## Export Format Specifications
+ 
+ ### KML Export
+ - Use SimpleKML for KML generation
+ - Include location metadata in placemark descriptions
+ - Support custom styling per location type
+ - Generate valid KML 2.2 format
+ 
+ ### GeoJSON Export
+ - Follow RFC 7946 GeoJSON specification
+ - Include all location properties in feature properties
+ - Use Point geometry type for locations
+ - Maintain coordinate precision (6 decimal places)
+ 
+ ### HTML Map Export
+ - Use Folium for interactive map generation
+ - Include layer controls for location grouping
+ - Add popup information with location details
+ - Ensure self-contained HTML files
+ 
+ ## Performance Guidelines
+ 
+ ### Large Dataset Handling
+ - Process locations in chunks (1000+ locations)
+ - Use generators for memory-efficient iteration
+ - Implement clustering for dense location areas
+ - Cache expensive map operations
+ 
+ ### Memory Optimization
+ - Clean up Folium map objects after export
+ - Use streaming for large file operations
+ - Monitor memory usage during map generation
+ - Implement progress indicators for long operations
  
```

Perfect! I've added the key enhancements to your `.cursorrules` file:

## Added Sections:

1. **AI Agent Integration** - Guidelines for the `map_locations_ai/` package
2. **Data Format Standards** - YAML structure and validation rules
3. **Export Format Specifications** - KML, GeoJSON, and HTML export details
4. **Performance Guidelines** - Large dataset and memory optimization

These additions provide Cursor with:
- Clear understanding of your AI package structure
- Specific data format requirements
- Export format specifications
- Performance considerations for large datasets

The enhancements are concise and focused, maintaining the high quality of your existing `.cursorrules` file while adding essential context for Cursor to better understand your project's specific requirements and patterns.

Perfect! I've updated the `.cursorrules` file to remove specific field names and implementation details, replacing them with references to the appropriate documentation files:

## Changes Made:

1. **Data Format Standards** - Removed specific YAML field examples and replaced with:
   - Reference to `docs/data-format.md` for complete specifications
   - Reference to `examples/sample_locations.yaml` for format examples

2. **Export Format Specifications** - Removed detailed format specifications and replaced with:
   - Reference to `docs/export-formats.md` for detailed specifications
   - Reference to `examples/` directory for format examples

This approach keeps the `.cursorrules` file focused on high-level guidelines and coding standards while directing Cursor to the appropriate documentation files for specific implementation details. This makes the rules more maintainable and reduces duplication.
