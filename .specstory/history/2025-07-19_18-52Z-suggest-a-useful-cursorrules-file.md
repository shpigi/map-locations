+ # Cursor Rules for Map Locations Project
+
+ ## Project Overview
+ This is a Python library and CLI tool for mapping locations with interactive filtering and visualization capabilities. The project uses Folium for interactive maps, YAML for configuration, and supports multiple export formats.
+
+ ## Code Style and Standards
+
+ ### Python Code Style
+ - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
+ - Use type hints for function parameters and return values
+ - Keep functions focused and single-purpose
+ - Use descriptive variable and function names
+ - Add docstrings for all public functions and classes
+ - Use f-strings for string formatting (Python 3.6+)
+
+ ### File Organization
+ - Keep related functionality in the same module
+ - Separate CLI logic from core library functionality
+ - Use `__init__.py` files to expose public API
+ - Group imports: standard library, third-party, local imports
+
+ ### Documentation
+ - Write clear, concise docstrings using Google or NumPy style
+ - Include examples in docstrings for complex functions
+ - Update README.md when adding new features
+ - Document CLI commands and their options
+
+ ## Development Guidelines
+
+ ### Error Handling
+ - Use specific exception types rather than generic `Exception`
+ - Provide meaningful error messages
+ - Handle file I/O errors gracefully
+ - Validate input data early and clearly
+
+ ### Testing
+ - Write unit tests for core functionality
+ - Test edge cases and error conditions
+ - Use pytest for testing framework
+ - Mock external dependencies in tests
+
+ ### Data Validation
+ - Validate YAML structure and required fields
+ - Check coordinate ranges (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
+ - Ensure required fields are present in location data
+ - Provide helpful error messages for invalid data
+
+ ## Project-Specific Rules
+
+ ### Map Generation
+ - Use Folium for interactive map creation
+ - Implement consistent color coding for location types
+ - Support multiple grouping options (neighborhood, type, date)
+ - Include layer controls for group visibility
+ - Add popup information with location details
+
+ ### CLI Interface
+ - Use argparse for command-line argument parsing
+ - Provide helpful help messages
+ - Support multiple input/output formats
+ - Include progress indicators for long operations
+
+ ### YAML Configuration
+ - Use PyYAML for YAML parsing
+ - Validate YAML structure against expected schema
+ - Support optional fields with sensible defaults
+ - Handle missing or malformed YAML gracefully
+
+ ### Export Formats
+ - Support KML export using SimpleKML
+ - Generate valid GeoJSON format
+ - Create self-contained HTML maps
+ - Ensure exported files are properly formatted
+
+ ## Code Quality
+
+ ### Performance
+ - Use generators for large datasets
+ - Minimize memory usage when processing locations
+ - Cache expensive operations when appropriate
+ - Use efficient data structures
+
+ ### Security
+ - Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
+ - Sanitize user input for file operations
+ - Use safe YAML loading (avoid `yaml.load()`)
+ - Handle sensitive data appropriately
+
+ ### Maintainability
+ - Write self-documenting code
+ - Use constants for magic numbers and strings
+ - Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
+ - Use meaningful variable names
+
+ ## Common Patterns
+
+ ### Location Data Structure
+ ```python
+ Location = {
+     'name': str,           # Required
+     'type': str,           # Required
+     'latitude': float,      # Required
+     'longitude': float,     # Required
+     'tags': List[str],      # Optional
+     'neighborhood': str,    # Optional
+     'date_added': str,      # Optional
+     'date_visited': str     # Optional
+ }
+ ```
+
+ ### Function Signatures
+ - Use type hints for all function parameters
+ - Include default values for optional parameters
+ - Return meaningful values or None
+ - Use descriptive parameter names
+
+ ### Error Messages
+ - Be specific about what went wrong
+ - Include the problematic value when relevant
+ - Suggest how to fix the issue
+ - Use consistent error message format
+
+ ## Testing Guidelines
+
+ ### Unit Tests
+ - Test each function independently
+ - Mock external dependencies
+ - Test both success and failure cases
+ - Use descriptive test names
+
+ ### Integration Tests
+ - Test complete workflows
+ - Test file I/O operations
+ - Test CLI commands end-to-end
+ - Verify output formats
+
+ ## Documentation Standards
+
+ ### Code Comments
+ - Explain complex algorithms
+ - Document non-obvious business logic
+ - Comment on workarounds or limitations
+ - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
+
+ ### README Updates
+ - Document new features and options
+ - Include usage examples
+ - Update installation instructions
+ - Keep feature list current
+
+ ## Git Workflow
+
+ ### Commit Messages
+ - Use descriptive commit messages
+ - Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
+ - Keep first line under 50 characters
+ - Add details in body if needed
+
+ ### Branch Naming
+ - Use descriptive branch names
+ - Include feature/ or fix/ prefix
+ - Use kebab-case for branch names
+
+ ## Performance Considerations
+
+ ### Memory Usage
+ - Process large datasets in chunks
+ - Use generators for iteration
+ - Clean up resources properly
+ - Monitor memory usage for large maps
+
+ ### File I/O
+ - Use context managers for file operations
+ - Handle encoding properly
+ - Validate file paths before operations
+ - Provide progress feedback for large files
+
+ ## Security Best Practices
+
+ ### Input Validation
+ - Validate all user inputs
+ - Sanitize file paths
+ - Check file permissions
+ - Handle malformed data gracefully
+
+ ### File Operations
+ - Use absolute paths when needed
+ - Check file existence before operations
+ - Handle permission errors
+ - Validate file formats
+
+ ## Accessibility and UX
+
+ ### Map Features
+ - Ensure color coding is distinguishable
+ - Provide alternative text for visual elements
+ - Use high contrast colors
+ - Support keyboard navigation
+
+ ### CLI Interface
+ - Provide clear help messages
+ - Use consistent command structure
+ - Include examples in help text
+ - Handle invalid input gracefully
+
+ ## Future Considerations
+
+ ### Extensibility
+ - Design for easy addition of new location types
+ - Support custom color schemes
+ - Allow custom popup templates
+ - Enable plugin architecture
+
+ ### Scalability
+ - Support large numbers of locations
+ - Optimize map rendering performance
+ - Consider clustering for dense areas
+ - Plan for multiple map layers
+
+ Remember to update these rules as the project evolves and new patterns emerge.
