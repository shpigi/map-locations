I'll help you create a concise repository description line. Let me first examine the project structure and documentation to understand what this project does.

Based on my analysis of the project, here's a concise repository description line:

**Python library for interactive location mapping with AI-powered data curation and visualization capabilities**

This description captures the key aspects of your project:

1. **Core functionality**: Interactive location mapping and visualization
2. **Technology**: Python library with CLI tools
3. **AI component**: The AI agent for data curation and enrichment
4. **Key features**: Interactive maps, multiple export formats, YAML configuration

Alternative shorter versions if you need something more concise:

- **Interactive location mapping library with AI-powered data curation**
- **Python library for mapping locations with AI enrichment capabilities**
- **Interactive location visualization with AI data curation tools**

The description emphasizes both the core mapping functionality and the unique AI component that sets this project apart from other mapping libraries.
