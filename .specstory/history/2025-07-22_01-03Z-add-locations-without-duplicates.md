_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to add the provided locations to their YAML file `paris_london_trip_locations_v3.yaml`, but they specifically want to add them WITHOUT DUPLICATES. This means I need to:

1. Check if any of these locations already exist in the file
2. Only add the ones that don't already exist

Let me examine the locations they want to add:
- Arc de Triomphe
- Champs-Élysées
- Montmartre
- Sacré‑Cœur Basilica
- Place du Tertre
- Musée de Montmartre

Looking at the existing file, I need to search for any of these that might already be present. Let me search through the current content:

From scanning the file, I can see locations like:
- Eiffel Tower
- Louvre Museum
- Notre‑Dame Cathedral
- Musée d'Orsay
- Palace of Versailles
- Montmartre Tour Meeting Point (Metro Blanche)
- And many others...

I see there's a "Montmartre Tour Meeting Point (Metro Blanche)" but that's different from the "Montmartre" neighborhood entry they want to add.

Let me check more carefully for potential duplicates:

1. Arc de Triomphe - I don't see this in the existing file
2. Champs-Élysées - I don't see this in the existing file
3. Montmartre - There's "Montmartre Tour Meeting Point" but no general "Montmartre" neighborhood entry
4. Sacré‑Cœur Basilica - I don't see this in the existing file
5. Place du Tertre - I don't see this in the existing file
6. Musée de Montmartre - I don't see this in the existing file

So it looks like all 6 locations can be added as they don't appear to be duplicates of existing entries.


I'll strategically position these new Paris locations at the end of the existing Paris section, ensuring they're integrated seamlessly before the London locations begin. This maintains the file's current organizational structure while incorporating the new entries.</details></think>

I'll check for duplicates and add only the new locations to your YAML file. Let me first search to see if any of these locations already exist.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see that there's only a "Montmartre Tour Meeting Point (Metro Blanche)" entry, but no general "Montmartre" neighborhood entry. So all 6 locations are safe to add without creating duplicates.

Now I need to add these locations to the YAML file. I should add them in the Paris section, before the London locations start. Looking at the file, I can see the Paris locations end around line 551 with "Les Halles" and then the London locations start with "Residence Inn by Marriott London Kensington".

I need to add these 6 locations right before the London section starts. Let me find the exact line where London locations begin.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I found that the London section starts at line 588 with the comment "# London Locations". So I need to add the 6 new Paris locations just before that line.

Let me now add these locations to the file. I'll insert them right before line 588.</details></think>

Perfect! I found that none of these locations are duplicates in your file. I can see there's only a "Montmartre Tour Meeting Point" but no general Montmartre neighborhood entry, so all 6 locations are unique and can be added.

I'll add them to the Paris section, right before the London locations begin:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I notice that the edit created a duplicate of "Les Halles" - it added it at the beginning but left the original at the end.
