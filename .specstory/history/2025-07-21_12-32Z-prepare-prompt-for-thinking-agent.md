_**User**_

@/docs
I want you to prepare a prompt for a thinking agent such as o3 instructing them to use my pasted text to do the work that this project aims to do (i.e. the proccessing steps that we agreed on in the plan but simply using the ai)
@project_plan.md

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to create a prompt for a thinking agent like o3 to use their pasted text to perform the work that the map_locations project aims to do. Looking at the project_plan.md and the docs folder, I need to understand:

1. What the project does
2. The processing steps they agreed on
3. How to structure this as a prompt for an AI agent

Let me read through the relevant files to understand the project better.

From project_plan.md:
- The project has two main components: map_locations (core mapping) and map_locations_ai (AI agent)
- The AI pipeline is: Extract → Enrich → Validate → Export
- The data flow is: User Input → AI Agent → Enriched YAML → Mapping Tool → Interactive Map
- The AI agent should extract locations from text/URLs, enrich with external data, validate accuracy, and export to YAML format

From the docs folder, I should read the files to understand:
- What the expected data format looks like
- What the AI agent guide says
- What the API reference shows about the expected functionality
- The user guide to understand the overall workflow

Let me read these files to create a comprehensive prompt.</details></think>

I'll read through the documentation to understand the exact processing workflow and data formats, then create a comprehensive prompt for an AI thinking agent.

---

Read file: project_plan.md

---

Read file: docs/ai-agent-guide.md

---

Read file: docs/data-format.md

---

Read file: docs/user-guide.md

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project. Based on the documentation, here's what the map_locations project does and the AI processing pipeline:

**Project Overview:**
- It's a Python library for mapping locations with interactive filtering and visualization capabilities
- Uses YAML files to store location data
- Creates interactive maps using Folium
- Supports multiple export formats (HTML, KML, GeoJSON, JSON, CSV)

**AI Pipeline from project_plan.md:**
Extract → Enrich → Validate → Export

**The AI Agent should:**
1. **Extract** locations from user's pasted text/URLs
2. **Enrich** the data with additional information (coordinates, descriptions, official websites, etc.)
3. **Validate** the data for accuracy and completeness
4. **Export** to the YAML format that the main package can consume

**Location Data Structure (from data-format.md):**
```yaml
locations:
  - name: "Eiffel Tower"           # Required: Location name
    type: "landmark"               # Required: Location type/category
    latitude: 48.8584              # Required: Latitude coordinate
    longitude: 2.2945              # Required: Longitude coordinate
    tags: ["historic", "tourist"]  # Optional: List of tags for filtering
    neighborhood: "7th arrondissement" # Optional: Neighborhood or area name
    date_added: "2025-01-15"       # Optional: Date when added (YYYY-MM-DD)
    date_of_visit: "2025-01-20"    # Optional: Date of visit (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

**Success Metrics from project_plan.md:**
- Coordinate precision: within 50m for landmarks, 200m for neighborhoods
- URL relevance: >90% official website detection
- Content quality: tourist-relevant, factual descriptions

Now I'll create a comprehensive prompt for an AI thinking agent (like o3) to process user's pasted text and perform this AI pipeline.</details></think>

+ # AI Location Processing Agent Prompt
+
+ You are an AI agent specialized in extracting, enriching, and validating location data from text. Your goal is to process user-provided text and convert it into a structured YAML format suitable for interactive mapping and visualization.
+
+ ## Your Mission
+
+ Transform unstructured text containing location information into a well-structured YAML dataset following the Map Locations project specifications. You will implement the **Extract → Enrich → Validate → Export** pipeline.
+
+ ## Processing Pipeline
+
+ ### 1. EXTRACT Phase
+ **Goal**: Identify and extract location information from the provided text.
+
+ **Extract these elements:**
+ - Location names (landmarks, restaurants, museums, hotels, etc.)
+ - Location types/categories
+ - Any mentioned addresses or geographic references
+ - Contextual information (dates, descriptions, tags)
+ - Any coordinate information if present
+ - Neighborhood or area references
+
+ **Look for patterns like:**
+ - "We visited the Eiffel Tower in Paris"
+ - "Had dinner at Le Comptoir du Relais"
+ - "Stayed at Hotel des Grands Boulevards in the 2nd arrondissement"
+ - "The Louvre Museum is a must-see"
+ - Travel itineraries, blog posts, recommendations, or lists
+
+ ### 2. ENRICH Phase
+ **Goal**: Enhance extracted locations with accurate, complete information.
+
+ **For each location, determine:**
+ - **Precise coordinates** (latitude/longitude in decimal degrees)
+ - **Accurate type classification** using these categories:
+   - `landmark`, `restaurant`, `cafe`, `bar`, `museum`, `hotel`, `park`, `shop`, `passage`, `bridge`, `church`, `gallery`, `market`, `theater`, `monument`, `viewpoint`
+ - **Neighborhood/district** information
+ - **Relevant tags** for filtering (e.g., `historic`, `tourist`, `architecture`, `food`, `nature`, `art`, `shopping`)
+ - **Official or highly relevant URLs** (prioritize official websites, Wikipedia pages)
+
+ **Quality Requirements:**
+ - Coordinates accurate within 50m for landmarks, 200m for neighborhoods
+ - Use authoritative sources for geographic data
+ - Ensure URL relevance >90% (prefer official websites)
+ - Add descriptive tags that would help tourists filter and discover locations
+
+ ### 3. VALIDATE Phase
+ **Goal**: Ensure data accuracy and completeness.
+
+ **Validation Checklist:**
+ - [ ] All required fields present: `name`, `type`, `latitude`, `longitude`
+ - [ ] Coordinates within valid ranges: lat (-90 to 90), lon (-180 to 180)
+ - [ ] Location names are unique and descriptive
+ - [ ] Types use consistent, lowercase naming
+ - [ ] Dates in YYYY-MM-DD format if present
+ - [ ] Tags are relevant and useful for filtering
+ - [ ] No obvious geographic errors (e.g., Paris locations with NYC coordinates)
+
+ **Cross-validation:**
+ - Verify coordinates match the stated location and neighborhood
+ - Ensure type classifications are logical and consistent
+ - Check that neighborhoods/districts are accurate for the city
+
+ ### 4. EXPORT Phase
+ **Goal**: Output clean, structured YAML data.
+
+ ## Required Output Format
+
+ ```yaml
+ locations:
+   - name: "Eiffel Tower"
+     type: "landmark"
+     latitude: 48.8584
+     longitude: 2.2945
+     tags: ["historic", "tourist", "architecture", "iconic"]
+     neighborhood: "7th arrondissement"
+     date_added: "2025-01-15"
+     # date_of_visit: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # Only if mentioned in text
+
+   - name: "Le Comptoir du Relais"
+     type: "restaurant"
+     latitude: 48.8667
+     longitude: 2.3397
+     tags: ["food", "local", "authentic", "bistro"]
+     neighborhood: "6th arrondissement"
+     date_added: "2025-01-15"
+ ```
+
+ ## Data Structure Requirements
+
+ ### Required Fields
+ - `name` (string): Clear, descriptive location name
+ - `type` (string): Category from the approved list above
+ - `latitude` (float): Decimal degrees, -90 to 90

+ - Invalid date formats
+ - Generic or unhelpful tags
+
+ ## Example Processing
+
+ **Input Text:** "Had an amazing dinner at L'As du Fallafel in the Jewish quarter, then walked through the beautiful Place des Vosges. The next day we visited the Louvre and grabbed coffee at Café de Flore in Saint-Germain."
+
+ **Expected Output:**
+ ```yaml
+ locations:
+   - name: "L'As du Fallafel"
+     type: "restaurant"
+     latitude: 48.8571
+     longitude: 2.3590
+     tags: ["food", "middle-eastern", "local", "famous"]
+     neighborhood: "4th arrondissement"
+     date_added: "2025-01-15"
+
+   - name: "Place des Vosges"
+     type: "landmark"
+     latitude: 48.8553
+     longitude: 2.3656
+     tags: ["historic", "architecture", "square", "beautiful"]
+     neighborhood: "4th arrondissement"
+     date_added: "2025-01-15"
+
+   - name: "Louvre Museum"
+     type: "museum"
+     latitude: 48.8606
+     longitude: 2.3376
+     tags: ["art", "historic", "culture", "world-famous"]
+     neighborhood: "1st arrondissement"
+     date_added: "2025-01-15"
+
+   - name: "Café de Flore"
+     type: "cafe"
+     latitude: 48.8544
+     longitude: 2.3325
+     tags: ["coffee", "historic", "literary", "famous"]
+     neighborhood: "6th arrondissement"
+     date_added: "2025-01-15"
+ ```
+
+ ## Success Criteria
+
+ Your output will be considered successful if:
+ - [ ] All extracted locations have accurate coordinates (verifiable via Google Maps)
+ - [ ] Location types are appropriate and from the approved list
+ - [ ] Tags are relevant and would help tourists filter locations
+ - [ ] YAML format is valid and follows the exact structure specified

_**User**_

add a part covering additional optional location fields

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to add a section covering additional optional location fields to the AI agent prompt. I should look at the existing data format documentation to see what optional fields are available beyond what I already included, and add them to the prompt.

Let me check what optional fields I already covered and what might be missing from the data format documentation I read earlier.

From the data format documentation, I see these optional fields:
- `tags` (list of strings) - I covered this
- `neighborhood` (string) - I covered this
- `date_added` (string) - I covered this
- `date_of_visit` (string) - I covered this

Let me check if there are any other optional fields I might have missed or if I should expand on these. Looking back at the docs, it seems I covered the main optional fields, but I should probably expand the section to be more comprehensive and provide better guidance on how to handle these fields.

I should also check if there are any AI-enhanced fields mentioned in the project plan or other docs that I might want to include for the AI agent to consider.

Looking at the project plan, it mentions "AI-enhanced fields" and the AI agent guide mentions some additional considerations. Let me add a more comprehensive section about optional fields and how the AI should handle them.</details></think>

---

I'll add a comprehensive section covering additional optional location fields to help the AI agent understand all the available data enrichment opportunities.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully added a comprehensive section covering additional optional location fields to the AI agent prompt. This new section includes:

1. **Extended Optional Fields**: 9 additional fields beyond the basic ones (description, address, website, phone, opening_hours, price_range, rating, accessibility, languages, booking_required)

2. **Guidelines for Optional Fields**: Clear instructions on when to include extended fields, priority order, and quality guidelines

3. **Detailed Quality Guidelines**: Specific formatting and content guidelines for each type of field

4. **Complete Example**: Shows how all the extended fields would look in practice with Sainte-Chapelle

5. **Field Validation Rules**: Important validation requirements to ensure data quality

This addition makes the prompt much more comprehensive and will help AI agents create richer, more useful location datasets that provide travelers with all the practical information they need. The fields are prioritized so the AI knows what's most important, and the guidelines ensure data quality and consistency.

The user should now have a prompt that can generate much more detailed and useful location data from text input.</details></think>

---

I've added a comprehensive section on "Additional Optional Location Fields" to the AI agent prompt. This new section includes:

## **Extended Optional Fields** (9 additional fields):
- `description` - Brief tourist-relevant descriptions
- `address` - Full street addresses
- `website` - Official website URLs
- `phone` - International format phone numbers
- `opening_hours` - Operating hours with seasonal variations
- `price_range` - Price indicators (€, $$, "Free entry", etc.)
- `rating` - Ratings when mentioned or verifiable
- `accessibility` - Accessibility features
- `languages` - Supported languages
- `booking_required` - Whether reservations are needed

## **Clear Guidelines** for:
- **When to include** extended fields (only when confident and tourist-relevant)
- **Field priority** (required → basic optional → high-value → context-specific)
- **Quality standards** for each field type with specific formatting examples

## **Complete Example** showing Sainte-Chapelle with all extended fields properly formatted

## **Validation Rules** to ensure data quality and consistency

This enhancement makes the prompt much more comprehensive, enabling AI agents to create richer, more practical location datasets that provide travelers with essential planning information like opening hours, pricing, booking requirements, and accessibility features - all while maintaining high data quality standards.

The AI agent will now be able to extract and structure much more detailed and useful travel information from text input.
