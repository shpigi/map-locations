<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to identify which of the listed locations are NOT in the current file. I need to go through the attached file content and check each location against what's in the YAML file.

Let me go through each location they mentioned and check if it's in the file:

1. Victoria and Albert Museum - I see "Victoria & Albert Museum – East Storehouse" but not the main Victoria and Albert Museum
2. Natural History Museum - Yes, this is in the file
3. Science Museum - Yes, this is in the file
4. Hyde Park - I don't see this in the file
5. Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter - I see "Warner Bros. Studio Tour London" but the name doesn't include "The Making of Harry Potter"
6. Piccadilly Circus - I don't see this in the file
7. Trafalgar Square - I don't see this in the file
8. National Gallery - I don't see this in the file
9. Big Ben - I don't see this in the file
10. Palace of Westminster - I don't see this in the file
11. Westminster Abbey - I don't see this in the file
12. London Eye - I don't see this in the file
13. London Dungeon - I don't see this in the file
14. Borough Market - Yes, this is in the file
15. Tate Modern - I don't see this in the file
16. Sky Garden - I don't see this in the file
17. Tower of London - I don't see this in the file
18. Tower Bridge - I don't see this in the file
19. St. Paul's Cathedral - I don't see this in the file
20. Shoreditch - I don't see this in the file
21. Covent Garden - I don't see this in the file
22. Little Venice - Yes, this is in the file
23. Camden Market - I don't see this in the file
24. Greenwich - I don't see this in the file


25. Royal Observatory Greenwich - I don't see this in the file
26. National Maritime Museum - I don't see this in the file

I'll continue checking the remaining locations against the confirmed list of places in the file. Most of the locations mentioned are not present in the current document.

The verified locations include the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Warner Bros. Studio Tour, Borough Market, Little Venice, and the British Museum. Some notable tourist attractions like the Victoria and Albert Museum, Hyde Park, Piccadilly Circus, and Trafalgar Square are absent from the file's records.

I'll now examine the new list of museums and cultural sites to determine their presence in the document:

Sir John Soane's Museum, Leighton House Museum, The Old Operating Theatre Museum, Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, William Morris Gallery, British Museum, and Science Museum require careful cross-referencing with the existing file contents.

The specific locations of Sky Garden, Tower of London, Tower Bridge, St. Paul's Cathedral, Shoreditch, Covent Garden, Camden Market, Greenwich, Royal Observatory Greenwich, and National Maritime Museum need verification against the current documentation.</details></think>

Looking through the YAML file, I can identify which locations from your list are **NOT** currently in the file:

**Not in the file:**
- Victoria and Albert Museum (only the East Storehouse branch is listed)
- Hyde Park
- Piccadilly Circus
- Trafalgar Square
- National Gallery
- Big Ben
- Palace of Westminster
- Westminster Abbey
- London Eye
- London Dungeon
- Tate Modern
- Sky Garden
- Tower of London
- Tower Bridge
- St. Paul's Cathedral
- Shoreditch
- Covent Garden
- Camden Market
- Greenwich
- Royal Observatory Greenwich
- National Maritime Museum

**Are in the file:**
- Natural History Museum ✓
- Science Museum ✓
- Warner Bros. Studio Tour London ✓ (listed as "Warner Bros. Studio Tour London")
- Borough Market ✓
- Little Venice ✓

So out of your 26 locations, **21 are not in the current file** and only **5 are present**. The file currently focuses more on Paris locations and some lesser-known London attractions, but is missing many of London's major tourist landmarks.
