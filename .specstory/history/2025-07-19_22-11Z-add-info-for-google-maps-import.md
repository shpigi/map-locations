_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add information about importing locations into Google My Maps. Let me first examine the current README structure and then add the relevant information.


---

Read file: README.md

---

Now let me look at the export section to see where to add the Google My Maps information:


---

Read file: README.md

---

Now I'll add the Google My Maps import information. I'll add it right after the export section in the Quick Start guide, and also add a dedicated section about Google My Maps integration:


---



---

Now let me also add a dedicated section about Google My Maps integration later in the README, after the export commands section:


---

Read file: README.md

Now I'll add a dedicated section about Google My Maps integration after the export commands section:

Perfect! I've successfully added comprehensive information about importing locations into Google My Maps to the README. Here's what I added:

## Summary of Changes

I added Google My Maps integration information in two places:

### 1. Quick Start Guide (Section 4)
Added a new step in the Quick Start guide that explains how to:
- Export locations to KML format

### 2. CLI Usage Section
Added a dedicated "Google My Maps Integration" subsection that includes:
- Step-by-step instructions for importing KML files

_**Assistant**_

I'll analyze the README to identify and reduce duplications. Let me first examine the current structure to find repetitive content.


---

Read file: README.md

---

I can see several duplications in the README. Let me identify and fix them:

1. **Google My Maps information is duplicated** - appears in both Quick Start and CLI Usage sections
2. **Export commands are duplicated** - similar commands appear in Quick Start and CLI Usage
3. **Map commands are duplicated** - similar commands appear in Quick Start and CLI Usage
4. **Grouping options are duplicated** - similar examples appear in multiple places
5. **Tile provider information is duplicated** - appears in both Tile Providers section and CLI Usage

Let me fix these duplications:


---



---

Now let me consolidate the export commands by removing the duplication in the CLI Usage section:


---



---

Now let me consolidate the map commands by removing duplication and adding a reference:


---



---

Now let me consolidate the grouping options by removing the duplication in the Library Usage section:


---



---

Now let me consolidate the tile provider information by removing the duplication in the Configuration section:


---



---

Now let me remove the duplicate development setup section that appears twice:


---



---

Now let me consolidate the duplicate project structure section by removing the second one:


---



---

Now let me consolidate the duplicate acknowledgments section by removing the second one:


---



---

Let me check if there are any remaining duplications by looking at the end of the file:


---

Read file: README.md

---

I can see there are still some duplications at the end. Let me clean those up:


---
