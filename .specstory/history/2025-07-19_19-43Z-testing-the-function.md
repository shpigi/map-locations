# Testing the function (2025-07-19 19:43Z)

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you run the tests for the map_locations project. Let me first check the current test setup and then run the tests.


---

```bash
cd /home/lavi/lavi_src/map_locations && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

```
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ cd /home/lavi/lavi_src/map_locations
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ cd /home/lavi/lavi_src/map_locations
 && python -m pytest tests/ -v
/home/lavi/miniforge3/envs/agents/bin/python: No module named pytest
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$
```

---

It looks like pytest is not installed in the current environment. Let me check what testing dependencies are available and install them if needed.


---

Read file: requirements.txt

---

I can see that pytest is commented out in the requirements.txt file. Let me install pytest and run the tests:


---

```bash
pip install pytest
```

---

_**User**_

I've changed the venv. try again

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Let me try running the tests again with your updated virtual environment:


---

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

```
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ python -m pytest tests/ -v
/home/lavi/miniforge3/envs/agents/bin/python: No module named pytest
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$
```

---

It seems pytest is still not available in the current environment. Let me check what Python packages are available and try a different approach:


---

```bash
pip list | grep -i test
```

```
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ pip list | grep -i test
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$
```

---

Let me try running the tests using Python's built-in unittest module instead, since pytest isn't available:


---

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests/ -v
```

---

_**User**_

mabe use make?

---

_**Assistant**_

Good idea! Let me check if there's a Makefile that might have testing commands defined:


---

Read file: Makefile

---

Perfect! The Makefile has a `test` target that uses pytest. Let me try running the tests using make:


---

```bash
make test
```

```
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ make test
pytest tests/ -v --cov=map_locations --cov-report=term-missing
make: pytest: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:25: test] Error 127
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$
```

---

The Makefile is trying to use pytest but it's not installed. Let me try installing the development dependencies first, which should include pytest:


---

```bash
make install-dev
```

---

_**User**_

run mamba activate map_locations

---

_**Assistant**_



---

```bash
mamba activate map_locations
```

```
(agents) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ mamba activate map_locations
(map_locations) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$
```

---

Great! Now that we're in the `map_locations` environment, let me try running the tests again:


---

```bash
make test
```

```
(map_locations) (base) lavi@LT49200:~/lavi_src/map_locations$ make test

Great! The tests are running now. There's one failing test in the GeoJSON export function. The issue is that the test is looking for the exact string `"-74.0060"` but the actual output has `"-74.006"` (without the trailing zero). Let me check the core.py file to see how the GeoJSON export is implemented:


---

Read file: map_locations/core.py

---

Let me see the rest of the file to understand the complete implementation:


---

Read file: map_locations/core.py

---

Now I can see the issue. The problem is that when JSON serializes floating-point numbers, it doesn't preserve trailing zeros. The test expects `"-74.0060"` but the actual output has `"-74.006"`. Let me fix the test to be more flexible about the number format:


---



---

Now let's run the tests again to see if this fixes the issue:


---

```bash
make test
```

```

Excellent! All tests are now passing! üéâ

Here's a summary of what we accomplished:

## Test Results Summary

‚úÖ **All 10 tests passed** in 1.06 seconds

### Test Coverage:
- **map_locations/__init__.py**: 100% coverage (5 statements)
- **map_locations/core.py**: 99% coverage (82 statements, only 1 missing)
- **map_locations/cli.py**: 0% coverage (79 statements missing)

### Test Categories:
1. **YAML Loading Tests** (3 tests):
   - Valid YAML loading
   - Empty YAML handling
   - Missing locations key handling

2. **Export Function Tests** (5 tests):
   - JSON export
   - CSV export
   - GeoJSON export (fixed the floating-point precision issue)
   - KML export
   - All formats export

3. **Map Generation Tests** (2 tests):
   - Interactive map creation
   - Empty locations error handling

### Key Fix:
The only issue was in the GeoJSON test where it expected `"-74.0060"` but JSON serialization doesn't preserve trailing zeros, so the actual output was `"-74.006"`. I updated the test to match the actual behavior.

### Coverage Analysis:
- **Total coverage**: 52% (166 total statements, 80 missing)
- The CLI module has no test coverage, which is expected since it's primarily for command-line interface
- The core functionality is well-tested with 99% coverage

The test suite is now working perfectly and provides good coverage of the core functionality!
