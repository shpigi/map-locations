Now let me read the key files to understand their current structure and update them appropriately:


---

Read file: setup.py

---

Read file: pyproject.toml

---

Read file: map_locations/__init__.py

---

Now I'll update all the files with your information. Let me start with the README.md file:


---



---

Let me update both instances in the README:


---



---



---

Now let me update the setup.py file:

Let me check the .cursorrules file to see if it needs updating:

Read file: .cursorrules

The .cursorrules file looks like it contains project-specific rules and doesn't need updating with personal information. Let me run a final check to make sure I've updated everything:

```bash
