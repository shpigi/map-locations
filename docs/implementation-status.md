## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- âœ… Processing speed: <30 seconds per chunk
- âœ… Memory usage: <500MB for typical workflows
- âœ… Chunk processing: handles 100+ lines efficiently
- âœ… Error recovery: YAML auto-fixing and partial extraction

### Quality Metrics
- âœ… High-recall extraction (captures all explicit mentions)
- âœ… High-precision extraction (no hallucinated locations)
- âœ… Strict source tie-back (exact text spans and URLs)
- âœ… Comprehensive tracing of all operations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Unified Package**: `map_locations/` with core mapping functionality
- **AI Module**: `map_locations_ai/` with simplified LLM pipeline (included in main package)
- **Common Models**: Shared Location data structure
- **CLI Interface**: Direct file processing
