- âœ… High-precision extraction (no hallucinated locations)
- âœ… Strict source tie-back (exact text spans and URLs)
- âœ… Comprehensive tracing of all operations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Main Package**: `map_locations/` with core mapping functionality
- **AI Package**: `map_locations_ai/` with simplified LLM pipeline
- **Common Models**: Shared Location data structure
- **CLI Interface**: Direct file processing

### Data Flow
```

             (Â±10 overlap)   YAML                      timestamp.json
```

### Dependencies
- **Main Package**: folium, pyyaml, common utilities
- **AI Package**: openai, pyyaml, pathlib

## ðŸš€ Next Priorities

1. **URL Processing** - Integrate fetch tools for URL exploration
2. **Deduplication** - Implement duplicate detection and merging
3. **Content Filtering** - Add filtering capabilities for location types
4. **Enhanced Geocoding** - Add coordinate lookup for extracted locations

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
