# Extractors Component – Implementation Status

*Last updated: 2025-07-27*

## Implementation Status ✅

**Simplified approach successfully implemented:**

### **✅ Core Pipeline:**
- ✅ **LLM-Based Extraction** - Direct OpenAI API integration (gpt-4o-mini)
- ✅ **YAML Output** - Robust YAML generation with auto-fixing
- ✅ **Chunked Processing** - 100-line chunks with 10-line overlap
- ✅ **Comprehensive Tracing** - Immediate JSON logging of all operations

### **✅ Quality Assurance:**
- ✅ **High-recall extraction** - Captures all explicit mentions
- ✅ **High-precision extraction** - No hallucinated locations
- ✅ **Strict source tie-back** - Exact text spans preserved
- ✅ **YAML auto-fixing** - Handles malformed responses automatically
- ✅ **Partial recovery** - Extracts data even from broken responses

### **✅ Performance Targets Met:**
- ✅ <30s per chunk processing
- ✅ <500MB peak memory usage
- ✅ Robust error handling with fail-fast approach
- ✅ Complete trace coverage for debugging

## Current Architecture

### Simplified Data Flow
```
Input File → Chunking → LLM Processing → YAML Output → Trace Logs
     ↓           ↓           ↓              ↓           ↓
  Plain Text  100 lines   Locations    temp/chunk_N.yaml  trace/
             (±10 overlap)   YAML                      timestamp.json
```

### Location Format
```yaml
locations:
  - name: "Location Name"
    type: "landmark"
    description: "Short generated description"
    source_text: "Full relevant text from input"
    confidence: 0.8
    is_url: false
    url: ""
```

## Context & Typical Inputs

Most source documents fall into one of two shapes:

1. **Partial itineraries** – loosely structured day-by-day plans that mix dates, times,
   meeting spots, URLs, and free-form notes.
2. **Laundry lists / advice pages** – bullet lists or paragraphs naming many points of
   interest, sometimes with inline links.

The extractor succeeds on both with **high recall** and **no hallucinated locations**.

## Objectives & Constraints

• **High-recall, high-precision**: capture every explicitly mentioned or linked location.
• **Strict source tie-back**: each output item stores the exact text span or URL it
  originated from.
• **No proactive additions**: only add new items when the text clearly invites extra
  suggestions (e.g. "additional best museums …").
• **Simplified schema**:

```yaml
locations:
  - name: string               # best guess or "unknown"
    type: string               # landmark, museum, park, etc.
    description: string        # generated description
    source_text: string        # exact text from input
    confidence: float          # 0.1-0.9
    is_url: boolean           # true if URL detected
    url: string               # URL if applicable
```

## Pipeline Design

### LLM-Based Extraction

1. **Chunking**
   • Split into 100-line chunks with 10-line overlap
   • Preserve line numbers for debugging
   • Handle first/last chunk edge cases

2. **LLM Processing**
   • Direct OpenAI API calls (gpt-4o-mini)
   • Maximum recall extraction prompt
   • YAML output with proper formatting

3. **Response Handling**
   • YAML parsing with auto-fixing
   • Partial extraction for malformed responses
   • Validation of required fields

4. **Tracing**
   • Immediate JSON logging of all calls
   • Timing information and error capture
   • Complete debugging support

## Next Steps for Enhancement:

1. **URL Processing** - Integrate fetch tools for URL exploration (Phase 2)
2. **Deduplication** - Implement duplicate detection and merging
3. **Content Filtering** - Add filtering capabilities for location types
4. **Enhanced Geocoding** - Add coordinate lookup for extracted locations
