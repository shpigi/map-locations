## Current Architecture

### Modular Package Structure
The AI extraction functionality is now included as a module within the main `map-locations` package, providing a unified installation and development experience.

### Modular Data Flow
```
Input File → TextProcessor → LLMProcessor → YAMLProcessor → URLProcessor → Deduplicator → FileManager
                                   ↘ TraceManager (comprehensive logging)
```

### Enhanced Location Format
```yaml
locations:
  - name: "Location Name"
    type: "landmark"
    latitude: 48.8584
    longitude: 2.2945
    description: "AI-generated description"
    source_text: "Full relevant text from input"
    confidence: 0.8
    is_url: false
    url: ""
    address: "Full address if available"
    extraction_method: "llm"
```

## Context & Typical Inputs

Most source documents fall into one of two shapes:

1. **Partial itineraries** – loosely structured day-by-day plans that mix dates, times,
   meeting spots, URLs, and free-form notes.
2. **Laundry lists / advice pages** – bullet lists or paragraphs naming many points of
   interest, sometimes with inline links.

The extractor succeeds on both with **high recall** and **no hallucinated locations**.

## Objectives & Constraints

• **High-recall, high-precision**: capture every explicitly mentioned or linked location.
• **Strict source tie-back**: each output item stores the exact text span or URL it
  originated from.
• **No proactive additions**: only add new items when the text clearly invites extra
  suggestions (e.g. "additional best museums …").
• **Enhanced schema** with AI-generated fields:

```yaml
locations:
  - name: string               # best guess or "unknown"
    type: string               # landmark, museum, park, etc.
    description: string        # AI-generated description
    source_text: string        # exact text from input
    confidence: float          # 0.1-0.9
    is_url: boolean           # true if URL detected
    url: string               # URL if applicable
    address: string           # full address if available
    extraction_method: string # "llm", "manual", or "url"
```

## Pipeline Design
