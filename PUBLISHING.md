   - Create a token with "Entire account" scope
   - Save the token securely

4. **Install publishing tools**:
   ```bash
   pip install twine
   ```

## Publishing Steps

### 1. Test PyPI (Recommended First Step)

```bash
# Build the package
python -m build

# Check the package
twine check dist/*

# Upload to Test PyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ map-locations
```

### 2. Production PyPI

```bash
# Build the package
python -m build

# Check the package
twine check dist/*

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*

# Install from PyPI
pip install map-locations
```

### 3. Using the Publish Script

```bash
# Publish to Test PyPI
./scripts/publish.sh test

# Publish to Production PyPI
./scripts/publish.sh prod
```

## Package Information

- **Package Name**: `map-locations`
- **PyPI URL**: https://pypi.org/project/map-locations/
- **Install Command**: `pip install map-locations`

   - Increment the version number

3. **Build Errors**:
   - Run `make clean` first
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
